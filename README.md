# Neovim Configuration
My personal Neovim configuration.
Heavily inspired by [this config](https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli/nvim).

## Issues
`lualine.nvim` and `alpha.nvim`, for some unknown reason, causes memory usage to gradually increase while in the `alpha` start-up screen

`bufferline.nvim` buffer order isn't saved/loaded by `persisted.nvim`
